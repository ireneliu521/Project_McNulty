## MVP Summary

### Domain
The objective of this project is to help the credit card companies identify fraud transactions and build a more secure system for their customers. Building this model does not only help the company build its reputation but also can attract more customers. My main focus will be on the german credit card fraud dataset.

### Data
Dataset 1. German Credit fraud data
Features: Over Draft, Credit Usage, Credit History, Purpose, Current Balance, Average Credit Balance, Employment, Location, Personal Status, Other Parties, Residence Since, Property Magnitude, cc-age, Other Payment Plans, Housing, Existing Credits, Job, Number of Dependents, Own Telephone, Foreign Worker, Class

Dataset 2. Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset
Features: ID, Limit Balance, Gender, Education, Marriage Status, Age, Repayment Status, Amount of Bill Statement, Amount of Previous Payment, Default Payment Next Month

### Known Unknowns
* Known: The score of my initial logistic regression model is around 0.75. The only thing I did in this initial model is change some variables to dummy variables. The reason to run this model is to take a peek of this dataset. My next step after this would be perform feature engineering on some of the features.

* Unknown: At this stage, my unknown part would be on the second dataset. I'm trying to extract some useful information that I can use on my first dataset to see if it will help improving my model. I will also perform feature engineering and fit a model to the second dataset.
